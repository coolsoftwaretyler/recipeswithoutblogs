## TODO 

The following is a list of items I'd like to accomplish in the project. If you're looking to contribute, this is a great place to start. It's ordered from highest priority to lowest priority. 

1. Accessibility checks 
2. Migrate to Rails 6 
3. Migrate to libsass (or off SASS in general)
4. Move secrets files to [encrypted credentials](https://www.engineyard.com/blog/rails-encrypted-credentials-on-rails-5.2) from Figaro
5. Write tests 
6. Add search functions (by category, name, ingredients, etc.)
7. Add pagination (not using the pagination gem - let's roll our own)
