## TODO 

The following is a list of items I'd like to accomplish in the project. If you're looking to contribute, this is a great place to start. It's ordered from highest priority to lowest priority. 

1. Accessibility checks 
2. Thoroughly check HTML semantics and make improvements where possible 
3. Force SSL connections (once DNS config settles)
4. DRY out the repetitive views 
5. Migrate to Rails 6 
6. Migrate to libsass (or off SASS in general)
7. Move secrets files to [encrypted credentials](https://www.engineyard.com/blog/rails-encrypted-credentials-on-rails-5.2) from Figaro
8. Write tests 
9. Add search functions (by category, name, ingredients, etc.)
10. Add pagination (not using the pagination gem - let's roll our own)
