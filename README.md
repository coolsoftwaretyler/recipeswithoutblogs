## TODO 

The following is a list of items I'd like to accomplish in the project. If you're looking to contribute, this is a great place to start. It's ordered from highest priority to lowest priority. 

- Accessibility checks 
- Add character count to description input
- Migrate to Rails 6 
- Migrate to libsass (or off SASS in general)
- Move secrets files to [encrypted credentials](https://www.engineyard.com/blog/rails-encrypted-credentials-on-rails-5.2) from Figaro
- Write tests 
- Add search functions (by category, name, ingredients, etc.)
- Add pagination (not using the pagination gem - let's roll our own)
