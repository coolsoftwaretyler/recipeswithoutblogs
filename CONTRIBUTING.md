# Contributing 

Check out the [issues](https://github.com/ogdenstudios/recipeswithoutblogs/issues) in the project and look for the `good first issue` label if you're new to web development, rails, or the project (or if you're looking for an easy win). 

There are also some issues labeled `help wanted` - which likely mean we aren't very certain how to fix them, and are looking for subject matter experts to take the reigns. 

If you've got any questions, go ahead and tag @ogdenstudios in the comments somewhere. 

## Code review 

At a minimum, your code must pass our accessibility tests and test suite. Bonus points if you can improve test coverage in either way. We'll review the code for known issues, potential bugs, and security concerns. If you're looking for feedback, make a note about it in your pull request and we'll be more explicit about that.
